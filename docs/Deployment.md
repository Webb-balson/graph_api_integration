## Deploying the FastAPI Service in a Production Environment

Deploying the FastAPI service in a production environment involves several steps to ensure scalability, security, and reliability. Below is a detailed guide:

### Components

#### FastAPI Application
Python application, containerized using Docker

#### Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)
- **ECS Cluster**: A logical grouping of container instances (e.g., Fargate).
- **ECS Fargate**: A serverless compute engine for containers that runs the FastAPI application containers, eliminating the need to manage EC2 instances.
- **ECS Task Definition**: Specifies the container image, resources (CPU, memory), and networking configuration for the FastAPI container.

#### Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple Fargate tasks, improving availability and fault tolerance.

#### Amazon Route 53
A highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service to map the domain name (e.g., `emailservice.example.com`) to the Load Balancer.

#### AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
Provides SSL/TLS certificates for the Load Balancer, enabling secure HTTPS connections.

#### MongoDB Atlas
MongoDB that stores email data.

#### Microsoft Graph API
Used to interact with Microsoft 365 email services.

#### Amazon CloudWatch
For logging and monitoring the application and infrastructure.

#### AWS Secrets Manager
Securely stores sensitive information, such as:
- Microsoft Graph API client ID and secret.
- MongoDB Atlas connection string.

### Deployment Process

#### Containerization
1. Create a Dockerfile for FastAPI application.
2. Build the Docker image.
3. Push the image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

#### Infrastructure Setup
1. Set up a VPC with appropriate subnets (public and private).
2. Create an ECS cluster in the VPC.
3. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
4. Configure Route 53 to point your domain to the ALB.
5. Request an SSL/TLS certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and associate it with the ALB.
6. Set up a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
7. Store sensitive credentials in AWS Secrets Manager.

#### Deployment
1. Define an ECS task definition, specifying the Docker image from ECR, resource limits, and networking.
2. Create an ECS service that runs and maintains the desired number of Fargate tasks based on the task definition.
3. Configure the ALB to route traffic to the ECS service.
4. Configure the FastAPI application to retrieve credentials from AWS Secrets Manager.

#### Monitoring and Logging
- Configure CloudWatch to collect logs from the Fargate tasks.
- Set up CloudWatch alarms to monitor application health and performance.

#### Microsoft Graph API Integration
Ensure the FastAPI application correctly authenticates with the Microsoft Graph API. This involves:
- Using the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL).
- Retrieving credentials from AWS Secrets Manager.
